TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

What I added:

I added a Pricing section for the various services. I figured it would reduce redundant questions coming in to the company email.
I included a table which had not been used previously.

I added an about me section. I always like to know who I'm working with and their story. I made this with a grid containing a picture
and a card. I made it responsive and made the columns stack once it got down to a smaller screen.

What I changed:

I changed the color theme to something a litle more me. It has blues, tans, and browns. I used adobe color
to make sure the color constrast looked best. 

I changed the main icon in the navigation bar to a smiley face because smiling is my favorite. 

I changed the cloud section to photography and changed the icon to a camera. 

I fixed the padding on the top of the names in the testimonials because the ovals containing the pictures 
got elongated. 

I removed the phone number that was in the navigation bar. I felt like it was distracting to me and 
I would personally not have my number so visible right there. So I adapted it to be more personalized to me.

I changed the trusted by section to "sponsored by" and added some of my favorite companies. I still wanted to include Amazon
because my husband and I got so many Amazon gift cards from our wedding.

I added an alert after the testimonials so people can send in their own for review.

I changed the section under "my services" to have quick links to more info on each section. This helps especially on mobile
devices so people don't have to scroll as far to find a specific section.

I changed all of the portfolio projects to my own projects.
